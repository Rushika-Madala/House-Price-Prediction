# Housing Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive analysis and machine learning model for predicting housing prices based on various features of California housing data.

## Project Structure
- Data Loading and Exploration
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training
- Visualization of Results

## Key Steps
1. **Data Acquisition**: 
   - Extracted housing data from a GitHub repository
   - Loaded and analyzed housing dataset

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Performed exploratory data analysis
   - Generated histograms to understand data distribution
   - Created statistical summaries of the dataset

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values
   - Created stratified train-test splits
   - Implemented feature scaling and transformation

4. **Model Development**:
   - Trained machine learning models for housing price prediction
   - Evaluated model performance
   - Visualized model results

## Dependencies
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## How to Run
